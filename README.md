## Projects

### Forecasting Consumer Credit Card Balances for Large Banks: A Time Series Analysis
Repo

The research explores the quarterly trends of consumer credit card balances for large banks and aims to forecast future balances using advanced time series methods. Insights from this study can help banks in strategic decision-making, risk assessment, and resource allocation. Applied simple to complex time series forecasting techniques and analysis of the model outputs.

### NHANES Informatics Project
[Repo](https://github.com/rogyizac/NHANES_informatics_project)

Performed a comparative analyses between survey respondent's demographics, health insurance coverage and hospital utilization levels. We undertook a detailed analysis of survey respondents data on their demographics, health insurance and health care utilization information. Identified deeper insights through data analyses, cluster analysis and through machine learning techniques and statistical models.

### Hand Gesture Recognition using CV
[Repo](https://github.com/rogyizac/Gesture-recognition-using-CV)

Utilized a Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) for real-time recognition of hand gestures such as thumbs up and open palms, mapping these gestures to keyboard functionalities like arrow keys and space bar. Leveraging OpenCV, the system translates detected gestures into corresponding keyboard actions, enabling intuitive gesture-based controls in applications. For example, in web browsing, gestures can mimic scrolling or page navigation, showcasing a seamless integration of computer vision and user interaction.
